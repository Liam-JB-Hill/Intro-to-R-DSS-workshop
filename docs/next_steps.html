class="section level2">
<h2>Advice on taking your next steps in learning R</h2>
<p>For the time being, I have developed this workshop to be
standalone.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope though that the exercises within the workshop have
whetted your appetite to <span style="color: red;"><strong>learn more
about how to use R as a platform for organising, managing, visualising
and/or analysing your data and disseminating your findings as Open
Science/Research</strong></span>.</p>
<p>To help you on this journey, I’ve compiled a list of ‘highly
recommended’ resources below that could be useful for you to check out
in future independent learning. I’ve tiered these in terms of things you
could get into quite quickly and some materials that you might want to
make a longer-term investment in.</p>
<div id="learning-more-about-rmarkdown-and-r-programming-basics"
class="section level3">
<h3>1. Learning more about RMarkdown and R programming basics</h3>
<p>In section [7.2.3.3. Emphasis] I already mentioned that Chester Ismay
has a really good introductory online ‘book’ that covers the basics of
RMarkdown. It’s called <a
href="https://rbasics.netlify.app/index.html">Getting Used to R,
RStudio, and R Markdown</a>. In particular, it’s useful if you want to
explore more the functionality of RMarkdown. However, in later chapters
he also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives an <strong>Intro to R using RMarkdown,</strong> which goes
through some of the basic programming principles you need to understand
when first learning to code in R. These exercises will cover a few more
thing than we’ve had time to cover in this workshop, so may prove
invaluable to you.</li>
<li>Gives some advice on <strong>Deciphering Common R Errors</strong>,
and links to some other blogs on this subject that offer good advice
too. A lot of the time learning in R is a process of making errors and
then spending time developing an understanding why your code hasn’t run,
using the Error message to help infer what’s gone wrong. After a while
you’ll get quite good at this and less irritated by the fact things
typically don’t ‘go right first time’!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="building-your-data-management-and-visualisation-skills"
class="section level3">
<h3>2. Building your Data Management and Visualisation Skills</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most researchers that have learned how to use R
in the last decade or so have done so whilst making use of Hadley
Wickham’s <code>tidyverse</code> packages, which make the programming of
R more intuitive and user friendly.</p>
<p>He has a great book with lots of activities and exercises within it
called <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, which
is freely available as an open access online book. If I could only
recommend one resource this would be <em>THE</em> book I’d suggest
someone with no experience of programming who wants to start with, as
they begin to learn how to use R. It gets you up to speed on how to use
the tidyverse packages, which offer some great tools for visualising and
‘tidying’ your data (i.e. <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>tidyr</code>,
respectively). In R4DS’s later chapters it even starts to introduce some
statistical modelling concepts too.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="using-r-to-do-statistical-analyses" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Using R to do Statistical Analyses</h3>
<p>There’s a several specific packages, courses and textbooks that I
think are really good ways of getting yourself up-skilled in doing
various types of analysis in R. I am by no means aware of every package
or teaching text that exists in relation to #RStats.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Below is simply a list of some I’ve either used and found valuable or
that come ‘highly recommended’ from my past project and PhD
students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, if you liked Chester Ismay’s introductory online book
(mentioned in section [8.1 Learning more about RMarkdown and R
programming basics]) he also has one that covers some of the basics of
statistical analysis in R, called <a
href="https://moderndive.com/v2/">ModernDive</a>. Again, it’s completely
free and open access .<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It’s relatively short and, like <a
href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, it doesn’t get
deep into ‘advanced’ stats, only going as far as multiple
regression.</li>
<li>For a much broader and comprehensive package for teaching you
statistical methods you could check out Andy Field’s <a
href="https://milton-the-cat.rocks/adventr.html">Adventr</a> package.
The package was created as a series of interactive tutorials that you
can run within R that go alongside his 2016 textbook: <a
href="https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/an-adventure-in-statistics/book275264">An
Adventure in Statistics: the reality enigma</a>. The package is free, as
are the tutorials within it, and some of my past PhD students
recommended this as a good introductory text for doing stats in R.
Andy’s textbook obviously isn’t free though!<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Lastly, there may come a time when your interest in statistics leads
you beyond ‘traditional’ frequentist (Null Hypothesis Significance
Testing) approaches and into the world of Bayesian Modelling. If that
happens, then R is really the best package to use and the best
introductory textbook I’ve found on these methods is called <a
href="https://xcelab.net/rm/">Statstical Rethinking</a>, by Richard
McElreath. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rmcelreath">lectures
are on youtube</a> too (if you fancy watching rather than reading) and
his <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024">online
materials to support his teaching</a>, which basically goes through his
book’s content, I’ve also found really accessible too!</li>
</ul>

<div class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Mostly, it covers the basics of linear regression
modelling.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>There are well over 10,000 R packages on the CRAN
server, available for you to download. Only a proportion of them will be
packages for doing statistical modelling. However, if you think that
some of these packages are almost equivalent in scope to the
functionality paid-for stats packages, like SPSS, offer, you quickly
begin to the realise the increased potential R offers you.<a
href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Hopefully you’re noticing a theme here!<a href="#fnref3"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>If you want the back-story of how I got interested in R,
I first learned statistics largely in SPSS, drawing heavily on Andy
Field’s then seminal textbook: <a
href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/discovering-statistics-using-ibm-spss-statistics/book285130">Discovering
Statistics Using SPSS</a>, which is now on its 6th edition. However,
during my PhD I would frequently find myself running into brick walls
when reading sections of that textbook. Andy would allude to certain
‘robust’ analyses being extremely useful alternatives to more
bog-standard ones that I was finding I couldn’t use because my data
unhelpfully violated various assumptions. Only, Andy explained that SPSS
couldn’t help me run any of these new-fangled analyses. Instead, I was
advised that I’d have to learn how to run them in a (at the time) “new
on the scene” stats software called R. What is more, Andy then released
a textbook in 2012 called <a
href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067">Discovering
Statistics Using R</a>, which was basically an expanded version of his
original SPSS textbook, with extra sections added in all the places
where I’d previously found dead-ends because R trumped SPSS in being
able to run the robust methods. Need I say more – at that point I was
100% converted!🤩<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
