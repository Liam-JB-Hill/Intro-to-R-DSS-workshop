<div id="what-is-r-and-what-are-its-advantages" class="section level2">
<h2>1. What is R and what <em>are</em> its advantages?</h2>
<p>This workshop will introduce you to a programming language, called R,
which is a particularly useful tool to use when you need to handle and
organise quantitative data and/or statistically analyse this kind of
data.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There are several upsides (and a few challenges) associated with
learning to use R, which I’ve summarised in this first section. For a
fuller explanation of why R is a useful tool for researchers, especially
those who want to do <a

Analysis</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, please refer back to my session on this
subject earlier in the week: <a href="">link to previous
session</a>.</p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Top tip/pointer:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>If you have attended the previous session (see link above), feel free
to skip the rest of section 1. This will just be a recap of some key
points from it.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-advantages-of-learning-to-use-r" class="section level3">
<h3>1.1 The advantages of learning to use R</h3>
<p>Many of R’s advantages come from how well it aligns with the
increased need for openness within academic research (i.e. the <a
href="https://www.cos.io/open-science">Open Science</a> agenda). The
Open Science research movement has its origins in Psychology<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but has
since expanded to many other disciplines, across both biomedical and
social sciences. Whilst the benefits of Open Science are many, the
specific value of R within this context is that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R is open source.</strong> That means it is free for
anyone to download and use. As is RStudio, which is the “Development
Environment” in which you actually spend most of your time drafting and
trialing your R code before running it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R fully supports reproducibility of your
analyses</strong>. Briefly, when using R to analyse data the process
involves you creating a ‘script’ file. This Script contains the lines of
code you wrote in order to: (1) wrangle the raw data you are working
with into an analysable format and then (2) run statistical tests on
that tidied data. Many academic journals now ask researchers to publish
not just their data alongside their paper but also some form of
‘analysis script’ file too. Providing both data and analysis script
files enables full transparency of your workflow. This helps facilitate
further research in the future, which may be looking to reproduce or
advance on your original work. Providing others access to your Analysis
Script is, essentially, what it means to do <em>Open Analysis</em>.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In combination, these are powerful and important points because it
means that <strong>if you use R to carry out your analysis you will be
doing so in a way that allows others to easily check, learn from, and
reproduce your work.</strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This
makes it a great Open Science/Research tool.</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div id="the-disadvantages-of-not-learning-to-use-r"
class="section level3">
<h3>1.2 The disadvantages of not learning to use R</h3>
<p>In contrast, many paid for stats packages are much less well suited
to such ‘openness’ because of the more intuitive, but ultimately opaque,
interfaces they offer (e.g. drop down menus, drag and drop interfaces).
This results in a much less transparent record of the steps you took
when doing an analysis, making it harder for others to check, learn
from, and/or replicate exactly what you did when analysing your
data.</p>
<p>That brings me to another advantage of R over paid-for packages
(e.g. SPSS, STATA, SAS). Because R is open source (AKA <em>FREE!</em>),
<strong>it’s a tool you can take with you into any future workplace
(e.g. after finishing your degree)</strong>. Knowing how to manage data
and perform statistical analysis in a paid-for package (e.g. SPSS) is
impressive but knowing how to do this in R is potentially <em>even
more</em> valuable to you in the long run. For example, what if you’re
working for an employer that doesn’t already hold a licence for SPSS?
Perhaps they’ve already invested in an alternative proprietary stats
packages (e.g. STATA, SAS) or simply can’t afford an SPSS license?
Indeed, there are many different stats packages out there and not every
organisation invests in uses the same one(s). This fact means R is often
a <strong>much better tool for collaboration too</strong>. In projects
where you want to work across institutions and, especially, with those
outside academia, conducting your analysis via an open-source platform
like R can be vital. This ensures a ‘shared language’ is used amongst
collaborators, which is accessible to all. <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="the-challenges-involved-in-learning-to-use-r"
class="section level3">
<h3>1.3 The challenges involved in learning to use R</h3>
<p>Being fair, R does have a steeper learning curve for new users than
stats packages that use drop-down menus and graphical user interfaces.
The <strong>command line entry method</strong> you have to use to ask R
to do things certainly feels less intuitive and more unforgiving to
begin with. Think of it as <strong>learning a new language</strong>, in
the course of learning about data management and statistics. That means
fixing grammar and punctuation errors in your use of this new
<em>programming</em> language will likely be something ‘extra’ that
slows you down a little more as you learn to ‘run your first analysis’
and get some results to interpret. This need to ‘speak R’s language’
with reasonable fluency does reduce the risk of you from simply
FAFO-ing<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
your way through deceptively simple ‘drag-and-drop’ analysis menus to
arrive at a set of incorrect results as your output though 😱</p>
<p>An advantage of R, which could also be viewed as a disadvantage (at
least initially), is that <strong>the functions you use within R to run
certain statistical tests often require you to be more precise in your
defining of them</strong>. For example, most methods for running
Multi-Level Models in R require you to specify the covariance structure
you want applied in the model or they won’t run. In constrast, if you
don’t specify the covariance structure in a Multi-level Model in SPSS it
will ‘help you out’ by applying its default choice of covariance
structure for you (i.e. Variance Components). In the long run, it’s
certainly a good thing that R more frequently forces you to make
conscious decisions about important features of your models. However, it
does again steepen the learning curve as you begin to learn about some,
particularly more advanced, statistical methods because you generally
need to know <em>more</em> about how they work before you can start
practicing and learning how to build them in R.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-in-overcoming-these-challenges" class="section level3">
<h3>1.4 Help in overcoming these challenges</h3>
<p>There is a lot of support out there that you can call upon when you
get stuck whilst using R too. Because R is open access, a <strong>very
vibrant user community</strong> has grown up around it over the past
10-15 years. There are great advice forums and online how-to guides
(e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, <a
href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r">StackExchange</a>,
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a>, <a
href="https://rc2e.com/">Cookbook for R</a>, <em>and many more</em>).
Nine times out of ten, when you get stuck trying to do something in R a
quick ‘google’ of <em>“how to do X in R?”</em> will bring up dozens of
links to solutions.</p>
<p>Extending this, <strong>GenAI can even be a helpful, time-saving tool
for R-Users too (e.g. helping you debug your code by spotting/explaining
errors in it)</strong>. <span
style="color: red;"><strong>However</strong>, I would strongly recommend
developing your own knowledge and skills in R to a decent level
<em>before</em> trying to use these GenAI tools to help you cut corners
and speed up your coding.** Please see this <a
href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/teaching-matters/genai-vs-academic-skills-development/">blog
by John Wilson</a> for a more detailed argument for why responsible use
of GenAI when learning to code is <em>really</em> important and worth
your patience and effort!</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="so-what-is-the-purpose-of-this-workshop"
class="section level2">
<h2>2. So, what is the purpose of this workshop?</h2>
<p>Think of this workshop as <strong>a ‘day 1’ introduction to R, that
will ensure you have a good grounding in its core features</strong>. It
will also cover some foundational principles for how I would recommend
you try to work within R. Consquently, <strong>this workshop will help
you establish a good ‘workflow’ in R</strong> from the outset, which
enables you to then use it efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Thus, you might want to think of this workshop as a ‘down-payment’,
designed with the aim of flattening your future learning curve in R as
much as possible. It certainly contains a lot of ‘foundational’
information (e.g. about good habits to get into when using R) that I
wish I had been taught back in 2008, when I first became an R-User!</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">This workshop is <em>NOT</em> going to jump
straight into teaching you how to do statistical analyses in R.</span>
That would be too much to also throw at you in this first workshop. It
is a logical ‘next step’ you could take though (see advice below)…</p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>At the end of this workshop I <em>will</em> point to some really good
online courses that you can then use to get going with learning how to
use R to do all sorts of interesting things though, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidying up and manipulating new data you’ve collected, wrangling it
into a state that is analysable.</li>
<li>Visualising your data (e.g. using Graphs, Charts, Tables).</li>
<li>Statistically analysing your data, using either Null Hypothesis
Significance Testing (NHST) and Bayesian methods.</li>
</ul>

<div id="getting-set-up-with-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Getting set up with R and RStudio</h2>
<p>R is a programming language and on its own can be <em>VERY</em>
cumbersome to use. You’re not going to get the most out of it this way
either (e.g. some of the ‘reproducibility’ advantages discussed in
section 1). For that reason, we tend to <strong>use R indirectly through
a second software that ‘wraps’ around it known as a “Integrated
Development Environment (IDE)” or “Code Editor”.</strong> The specific
Code Editor we’re going to use in this role is called
<strong>RStudio</strong>. RStudio allows us to more easily play around
and test out our code out as we’re building. This software is also a
little more user friendly (e.g. there are some drop-down menus 😃) and
it has additional functionality within it that better allows us to
generate a record of the steps we’ve gone through to write our code and
develop it.</p>
<p>With that explained, below are instructions on how to download and
install R and RStudio onto a computer you have permission to download
software onto.</p>
<div class="warning">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Warnings!</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>If you are on a University owned computer</strong> (e.g. a PC
in a computer cluster) this will normally have R and RStudio
pre-installed.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If it is not pre-installed</em> then R and R studio should be
downloadable via the university’s Software Centre app. Full information
on that app and how to use it can be found <a
href="https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/desktop-personal/supported/windows-10/training/software-center">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If your own computer already has R and/or RStudio
installed</strong> then either use the version you already have or
uninstall these prior versions before completing the install steps
below.</p>
</div>
<p><br> First, we need to <strong>download and set up</strong> <span
style="color: red;"><strong>R</strong></span>, do so by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Going to the CRAN website, or to give it its full name: the
“Comprehensive R Archive Network”: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"
class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>In the <strong>Download and Install R</strong> window click the link
to take you to the version of R you need (i.e. the version specific to
the operating system on your computer). If you want to:<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downloading R for macOS</strong>, first check which Apple PC
you have. On the top-left of your screen click the Apple logo, click
About This Mac, noting what the Processor line says. Then select the
appropriate package, based on your machine, from the list to
download.</li>
<li><strong>Downloading R for Windows</strong>, then I’d follow their
advice to install the ‘base’ package by clicking the link to
<strong>install R for the First time</strong>). This will take you to a
page where you can download: <span style="color: blue;"><em>Download
R-4.4.3 for Windows</em></span>, which is what I’d do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the file has downloaded, go to you downloads folder, open the
installer you have just downloaded and follow the instructions to
install, while keeping the default options.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, we need to <strong>download and set up</strong> <span
style="color: red;"><strong>RStudio</strong></span>, do so by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Going to the following webpage: <a

R</em> prompt as you scroll down (you’ve already installed it).</li>
<li>Scroll further down to the <strong>All Installers and
Tarball</strong> table and download the version appropriate for your
Operating System (e.g. Windows, macOS).</li>
<li>Once the file has downloaded, go to your downloads folder and…

just downloaded to unpack it.</li>
<li>In the window that opens up drag the RStudio icon and drop it into
the <em>application folder</em>.</li>
<li>Double click on the applications folder to open it, find RStudio in
the list and double click on it to open it up.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>If on a Windows PC</em>:
<ul>
<li>If on a Windows PC double click on the <span

<p><br> We’ll explain in a moment how to interpret what you’re looking
at in this window. First though we’ll take one more step to
<strong>initiate our first <span style="color: red;">project</span> in
R, because within R we use projects to organise our
<em>workflow</em></strong>. For example, imagine you start a research
program that is going to involve a series of studies. For the analysis
of the data from these studies you could create one R project and within
this project you could have a sub-folder for each study. In these
folders you would then keep the data for each study, the script file(s)
for analysing each of these datasets and any other relevant metadata.<a

<h3>4.1. Creating your first R Project</h3>
<p>To create a new Project in RStudio:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the drop-down menu at the top of RStudio select <strong>File &gt;
New Project…</strong></li>
<li>In the New Project Wizard window that pops up select <strong>New
Directory</strong>.</li>
<li>On the next window, define your project type as a <strong>New
Project</strong>.</li>
<li>On the next window, in <strong>Directory Name:</strong> give your
project a name (e.g. <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_R_project</em></span>).</li>
<li>If you then click on <strong>Create Project</strong>, you’ll find
this Project is created as a folder in whatever default location new
folders are created in on your computer. You have the option to select
where on you would prefer this project to live though (e.g. on your
desktop, on your university onedrive). To do this click <strong>Browse…
and selecting your preferred location</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Think <em>carefully</em> about where you want your project to be
housed, as it will normally also contain an electronic copy of the data
from your research. Therefore the location of this project should be in
a suitably secure location, which complies with the standards set out
when you obtained ethical approval for your research.</p>
<p>For example, the extra data security offered by housing your project
on a Univeristy server or cloud based service (e.g. onedrive) may be
essential if you are going to be handling sensitive data as part of your
project!.</p>
</div>
<p><br> You’ll notice that having created your project, the bottom right
pane in RStudio has changed. It now indicates that you are now working
within this new directory/project on your computer (see image
below):</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_R_project.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br> One final step we’ll go through, before I explain RStudio’s
layout, is to create a file within your new project. Specifically, let’s
create an R Script. These as a type of files that I mentioned in section
1, within which we often code/write the instructions for our analyses.
That means they’re the specific files we often want to share when we
want to do <em>Open Analysis</em> and make our workflow publicly
available.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-your-first-r-script" class="section level3">
<h3>4.2. Creating your first R Script</h3>
<p>To create a new R script:</p>

</div>
<div id="understanding-a-typical-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>5. Understanding a typical workflow</h2>
<p>You’ll see we now have four panes within the R Studio window. To
understand how they interact in a typical workflow let’s focus first on
the top left pane first:</p>
<div id="the-code-editor-top-left-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>5.1. The code editor (top left pane)</h3>
<p>In the code editor the new, blank script that we have just created is
displayed (i.e. <span style="color: blue;">my_first_R_script.R</span>).
Think of this pane literally as a space where you can write <em>a
script</em>, just as you might if you wanted to rehearse for an
important presentation or interview. Essentially, you will end up
writing a list of instructions for R, which you will then want to
present to them<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. If you’ve written your script well, then
R will understand what you’re trying to ask it to do in this script, and
it will helpfully carry out these actions.</p>
<p>Before we get on to practicing doing that, let’s complete our tour of
the other panes though…</p>
</div>
<div id="the-console-bottom-left-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>5.2. The console (bottom left pane)</h3>
<p>This pane is literally a <em>window</em> into the R software program,
which RStudio has opened within it.</p>
<p>RStudio is very aware that it’s primary role is to act as a
go-between between you and R. So, within it (as illustrated below) is a
space:</p>
<ul>
<li>For you to write instructions (i.e. the code editor)</li>
<li>For R to receive these instructions and act upon them (i.e. the
console)</li>
<li>A mechanism for passing these instructions along<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, which we’ll explain
in a moment.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/script_to_console.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="command-r-to-do-something" class="section level4">
<h4>5.2.1. Command R to ‘do something’</h4>
<p>Let’s illustrate some important features of this workflow by giving R
some instructions to act on.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start by writing the the following, really simple sum
<code>1 + 1</code> into your R script.</li>
<li>The on the far right of the Code Editor press the <em>Run</em>
button (circled in <span style="color: red;">red</span> in the image
below). This will pass the instruction written in your script to the R
console, for it to carry out.</li>
</ol>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_sum.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br> This should produce the following output in the console shown
below, which shows us that R has heard our instruction, reporting it
back to us on the first line (i.e. <code>&gt; 1+1</code>) and on the
next one it has acted upon it by carrying out this sum for us
(i.e. <code>[1] 2</code>).</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_output.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="comment-on-your-commands" class="section level4">
<h4>5.2.2. Comment on your commands</h4>
<p>Now let’s show you how to also write ‘comments’ into your R script.
These are lines of code that aren’t passed on to your console when you
hit <span style="color: red;">Run</span>.</p>
<p>To make comments in the Script that aren’t passed on to R put a
<code>#</code> symbol in front of the line they appear on. For example,
amend your script so the first line reads <code>#1+1</code>, as
illustrated below:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_comment.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>What is different about the
console output if you hit Run now? Is the calculation carried out by R
in the console?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>No!</strong></p>
<p>Let’s combine what we’ve learned hear about comments and commands by
entering the following two lines of code into the editor:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1+1
# this is my first simple sum in R!</code></pre>
<p>Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hold down the left mouse button and highlight both lines of
code.</li>
<li>Press <em>Run</em> one final time.</li>
</ol>
Below is the output you should then see appear in the console (circled
in <span style="color: red;">red</span>):
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_output_with_comment.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>You’ll note the sum has been calculated again (after removal of the #
in front of it) but no additional output results from the additional
‘comment’ line we’ve added. The comment gets passed on to R but because
of the # symbol in front of that line R knows to ignore it. In other
words, it know you aren’t trying to give it ‘commands’ in the
<em>“hashtagged”</em> line.</p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>If you hit the Run button without selecting both lines then just the
line that your cursor is currently active on will run. Very often, we
have multiple lines of code we want to run in one ‘chunk’. To do this we
can highlight the section we want to <em>Run</em> manually, like we did
here. Alternatively, if we want to <em>Run</em> all the code within the
script:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Move your cursor back so it is active (flashing) on the first line
of your script.</li>
<li>In RStudio’s menu go to <strong>Code &gt; Run Region &gt; Run from
Line to End</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><br> Commenting as you go when you write code is an EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT activity. There’s a quite famous quote by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)">Martin
Fowler</a> that illustrates the problems that not making comments
regularly creates, which is:</p>
<center>
<strong><em>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.
<br> Good programmers write code that humans can
understand.”</em></strong>
</center>
<p><br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>Considering the advantages
that R has over programs that don’t encourage/allowing commenting. Why
do you think it would be advisable to comment frequently, and at length,
on code that you write whilst performing statistical
analysis?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue;"><strong>My answer:</strong></span> On a
purely selfish level, comments also help <strong>you</strong> structure
and plan out the code you need to write and, once it is written, aid
<strong>you</strong> in recalling to mind what different bits of code
do. This can be particularly useful if it’s been a few days/weeks/months
since you last looked at your analysis script and you’re trying to do
something complex within it. This all comes back to an issue of Language
too. As I mentioned in section 1.3, R needs you to communicate with it
in its Language but we also need to provide translation (for ourselves
and others) so that this ‘machine language’ is more easily interpretable
by humans!</p>
</div>
<div id="saving-your-r-script" class="section level4">
<h4>5.2.3. Saving your R Script</h4>
<p>Before we move on to look at the remaining two panes we’ll quickly
pause to save the code we’ve written in our R Script. The quickest way
to do this is to press the diskette symbol in the tool bar of the Code
Editor (circled in <span style="color: red;">red</span> in the figure
below):</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/saving_my_first_script.png" /></p>

<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>You’ll notice that as soon as we do this, the name of the Script in
the tab above turns <strong>black</strong>. If we wrote more code the
name of the Script would turn back to <span
style="color: red;"><strong>red</strong></span>, which is a useful
reminder that there is work within the script that has not yet been
saved!</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-environment-top-right-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>5.3. The Environment (top right pane)</h3>
<p>The panel in the top right defaults to showing you your current R
“environment”. This should be empty at the moment because we haven’t put
anything in our project’s environment yet. Often one of the first things
we’ll do when starting work on a project though is to load data into the
environment that we want to work with in some way.</p>
<p>Let’s have a go at doing that now by following these steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, we need to put some data in our project folder that we can
then load into our R Environment. To do this, download the <span
style="color: blue;"><em>ExampleSDQ_data.csv</em></span> dataset from <a
href="https://github.com/Liam-JB-Hill/Intro-to-R-DSS-workshop/blob/73d856dd76feed4c6e226649109fcbb870ce3cab/workshop_data/ExampleSDQ_data.csv">here</a>,
and place it in the *my_first_R_project** directory that you created
earlier</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Note 1:</em> On the webpage you’re taken to, click on the radio
button with three dots on it in the top right hand corner of your
screen, the first option on the drop-down menu that appears will be to
download this datafile.</li>
<li><em>Note 2:</em> I created my project on my desktop, so I just
dropped the file in its ‘folder’ there.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve done this correctly the file should now be listed in R
Studio in the bottom left pane (as per the screenshot below (added
dataset circled in <span style="color: red;">red</span>):</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_dataset.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Having put some data in our project directory/folder we can now
import it into our environment by adding the following line of code to
our script and running it:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>my_first_dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;ExampleSDQ_data.csv&quot;, header = T)</code></pre>
<p>This line instructs R to create an object called <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_dataset</em></span> in your
environment (<em>reminder</em>: top right pane in RStudio), which
contains the data from this file. There are many different types of
objects that we can place or create in our environment and we’ll discuss
a few of these different types in a bit more detail later. For now
though you can at least see that there is something in our environment
that wasn’t there before (circled in <span
style="color: red;">red</span> in the image below):</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_import.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Certain objects, like the one we’ve just created, which is called
dataframe, can be viewed and explored in more detail by clicking on them
in the Environment pane. This will open them up as a tab in the Code
Editor pane. For example, if you do that with the <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_dataset</em></span> object the tab
that opens contains a view of the data contained in this dataset.</p>
<p>Also, before we move on, here’s a few tips on the rules for naming
“objects” in R:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects’ names can’t begin with a number (e.g. 0, 1, etc…)</li>
<li>Objects’ names can’t contain symbols that denote other operations in
R or mathematical functions (for example: +, $, @, !, ^, -, / or *)</li>
<li>Object names are case sensitive, so be careful what you
capitalise!</li>
<li>Functions (which we talk about later) have their own names and it is
not a good idea to use the same name for an object as you do for a
pre-existing function, confusion will ensue 😖</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br> Below, you’ll see an extended illustration of the workflow that
we started to sketch out earlier. You’ll see that we have added a few
extra paths through the workspace RStudio lays out for you. Whilst
everything is still being controlled by what we write in the Code
Editor, this illustration shows how we often use the editor to instruct
R to do things that result in it interacting with the environment and
the project spaces, as well as the console. For example, we often ask R
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch things (e.g. datasets) from external directories in our R
project (which can be viewed in the bottom right pane) and put them the
internal environment of our R project (which is depicted in top right
pane), defining them as “objects” in the environment.</li>
<li>Once we have objects in our environment, we can instruct R to carry
out operations on the data it now has access to (e.g. we can instruct it
to carry certain analyses we want run on these datasets).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This part of the workshop has hopefully given you a good
overview of what you’re looking at when you now open up RStudio and the
basic ‘mechanics’ of the R workflow, as laid out within
RStudio.</strong></p>

<div id="function-and-packages-essential-tools" class="section level2">
<h2>6. Function and Packages: essential tools</h2>
<p>At this point R might not seem the most powerful tool because, so
far, you’ve only seen used it as a glorified calculator and data viewer.
Now though, <strong>we’re now going to look at some features which can
be used within the R workflow that really make it stand out from the
crowd</strong>! We’ve actually already used one of these features, to
upload our dataset into the environment…</p>
<div id="functions" class="section level3">
<h3>6.1. Functions</h3>
<p>Functions are a very powerful feature of R, they are basically
pre-packaged commands for performing more complex actions on your data
within R. A function is denoted by their name followed by a bracket,
within which a series of “arguments” are specified and separated by
commas. As so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function (argument1, argument2, etc...)</code></pre>
<p>The function we used in the previous section (<a
href="#the-environment-top-right-pane">5.3. The Environment (top right
pane)</a>) was called <code>read.csv</code>. It is a specific function
that performs the operation of importing a dataset of a certain type
into R ( <code>.csv</code> type files, to be specific ). You may recall
this line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_first_dataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;ExampleSDQ_data.csv&quot;, header = T)</code></pre>
<p>To explain what it did in more detail:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>[name] &lt;- [command]</code> layout of this code tells R
that you are commanding it to create an object. The name of the object
appears on the left of the <code>&lt;-</code> symbol
(i.e. <code>my_first_dataset</code>). The commands that instruct R tell
as to how the object is defined are then given to the right.</li>
<li>In this case, the commands that define the object uses the function
called <code>read.csv</code> to create a dataframe in your environment
that contains the data from the file you added to your Project
folder.</li>
<li>Within this specific function, the first argument
<code>“ExampleSDQ_data.csv”</code> tells R the name of the specific file
it needs to fetch from your project. The second argument
<code>header = T</code> is important too. It tells R something about how
the data is laid out within the file, but we’ll learn what exactly that
does in more detail a minute.</li>
</ol>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>One nice thing to notice about this approach to using data is that it
means the original data file, which is still in your folder remains
‘untouched’. You pull data into the R environment and can edit and play
around with this “object” as much as you want but this is completely
separate from the original datafile.</p>
<p>Providing you maintain good version control and comment on it
regularly, your script will have a record of all that ‘playing around’
too, which means you should pretty much always have a nice ‘paper trial’
from the raw data up to the ‘cleaned and tidied’ dataset you then
usually end up analysing.</p>
<p>This is less easy to do in some other stats packages, where you work
directly with the original data nad often overwrite or change that files
in ways can make it hard to retrace your steps back and start again,
should you ever need to.</p>
</div>
<p><br> <strong>The strength of R is in its functions</strong> because
when you become more skilled you can write your own functions to do
complicated (but necessary) things to your data. These then become
easily reproducible once you’ve written them as functions. For example,
behind the simple <code>read.csv</code> command you just used may lie
hundreds of lines of code that get it to work, but all you needed to do
to get it to run was input a couple of instructions (i.e. the arguments)
within this nicely packaged function’s parentheses!</p>
<p>Also, <strong>because R is open source other researchers are writing
new functions (and refining olds ones so they work better) all the
time</strong>. This is why “googling as you go” is a common practice
when working in R. There’s always new functionality to find that can
make your life easier or greatly improve your code’s efficiency or
effectiveness.</p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>This is an area where R tends to have the edge over proprietary
packages too (e.g. SPSS, STATA, SAS). This is because <strong>it is not
only a powerful statistical software but also a thriving community of
developers who, as you read this, are pushing the boundaries of what you
can do with R</strong>, developing new functions and publishing them as
open source materials for us to use in our future analyses.</p>
<p>For example, packages for doing advanced Bayesian Modelling were
available in R for almost a decade prior to SPSS getting around to
introducing some, very limited, functions for calculating Bayes Factors,
for certain types of analyses in mid-2017.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="the-help-function" class="section level3">
<h3>6.2. The Help function</h3>
<p>The idea of learning lots of new function’s names and their arguments
might seem daunting. After all, these are akin to learning new words and
syntaxes in a new language. You’ll quickly find that you can make good
progress in “making yourself understood” by learning a few common
functions you’ll use very frequently though (e.g. <code>read.csv</code>
whenever you want to load a new .csv file dataset into your
environment).</p>
<p>One of the more frequently used and important functions you’ll get
familiar with is <code>help</code> function, or more precisely:
<code>help()</code>. Enter the name of any function between help’s
bracket and run this request in the console and, in the bottom right
hand pane of RStudio, an explanation of the function you need ‘help’
understanding will pop up!</p>
<p>To find out more about the <code>read.csv</code> function run a help
request on it by entering the following command and running it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(&quot;read.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Read the Description in the R Documentation page that pops up in the
bottom right pane. Also, scroll down to the <strong>Arguments</strong>
list within it and find the entry for the <code>header</code> argument.
Here you will learn what this argument does when it is set to equal
<code>TRUE</code>, as was the case in your code.</p>

<p><strong>These are some extra things you can view in the bottom right

<p>Given we’ve briefly had our attention drawn to the bottom right pane
for the first time, we’ll take an opportunity to highlight what a few of
the other tabs within this area allow us to do/see:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Files</strong>, will show you your R project area. There’s
quick-button options to add additional folders, rename files etc… here
too.</li>
<li><strong>Plots/Viewer</strong>, is where visualisations of your data
will appear when you request them (e.g. graphs, charts etc…). Once
you’ve created them there’s also a button you can click on here to
export them in a variety of file-types.</li>
<li><strong>Packages</strong>, contains a list of all the R packages you
have loaded on your computer. <strong>What are R packages you might ask?
Well, that’s something we’re about to talk about… 😏</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="adding-packages-to-add-new-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>6.3. Adding Packages (to add new <em>Functions</em>)</h3>
<p>The <strong><em>“Functions”</em></strong> that are at the heart of
R’s amazing flexibility are <strong>stored in folders known as
“Packages”</strong>. There are literally thousands of add-on Packages
now available in R that allow you to do all sorts of new and exciting
things (e.g. new packages for doing different types of analyses that are
growing in popularity )<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. More packages are being created all the
time too, which build exponentially on R’s base functionality.</p>
<p>Within the last decade several packages have come along that contain
families of functions that have really enhanced the usability of R and
expanded its user base. In particular, there are packages created by <a
href="https://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> (e.g. <code>tidyr</code>,
<code>dplyr</code>, collectively referred to as part of the
<code>tidyverse</code> of R packages) that have made some of the
conventions of programming in R a bit more user-friendly, and thus
intuitive for new learners to get to grips with.</p>
<p>To illustrate the process of adding new packages to your R
environment we’re going show you how to add some of these
<code>tidyverse</code> packages, which some of my past students have
found very useful packages to learn as they started out with using
R.</p>
<div id="installing-new-packages" class="section level4">
<h4>6.3.1. Installing new Packages</h4>
<p>The first step when accessing new packages is to download them to
your computer. You can do this in RStudio using the
<code>install.packages()</code> function. First, we’ll create an object
that is a list of the names of five packages we want to add, called
<code>pkg</code>. Then, we’ll use the <code>install.packages()</code>
function to download this list of packages from an online
repository.</p>
<p>To complete these steps write the following code in your script and
run it in the console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># list of useful packages
pkg &lt;- c (&quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)

# install them, downloading them from the CRAN repository
install.packages(pkg, repos = &quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Your computer should happily whirr away for a minute or two
downloading these packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-new-packages-after-installing" class="section level4">
<h4>6.3.2. Loading new packages (after installing)</h4>
<p>Like datasets in your project directory/folder, the functions in the
packages we just installed packages <strong>are not</strong> immediately
available for you to now call upon in your environment. Instead,
whenever you start a project that needs to use functions from certain
package you need to load these packages into the project’s R environment
(i.e. top right pane, discussed in section 5.3). We do this by loading
them as <em>“libraries”</em>. To do this for the five packages you’ve
just installed, write the following code in your script and run it in
the console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># load the five packages that we just installed into your project&#39;s environment
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)</code></pre>
<p>In fact, it is not uncommon for the first few lines of any R script
to simply contain a list of lines like this, which ‘load up’ all the
libraries of functions needed to make the subsequent commands in the
script run in the R environment.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>there’s a simple drop-down menu option you can
use within R to search for and then download new packages</strong>. To
use this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the toolbar go to: <strong>Tools &gt; Install
Packages…</strong></li>
<li>You shouldn’t need to change the <strong>Install from:</strong>
option if you’re downloading a package from the CRAN repository (as we
did) but if you’re adding a package that you’ve previously downloaded to
your computer (e.g. as a .zip file) there’s an option to indicate this
here (i.e. <em>Package Archive File (.zip; .tar.gz)</em>).</li>
<li>You can then search for the name of the package you’re wanting to
download in the <strong>Packages (separate multiple with space or
comma):</strong> field. This has a nice auto-complete function in this
field too.</li>
<li>In <strong>Install to Library:</strong> decide where you want the
package to be downloaded to on the computer. <em>Note:</em> I rarely (if
ever) play around with the default here.</li>
<li>Normally, ensure <strong>Install dependencies</strong> is ticked.
this automatically downloads any additional packages that you might need
to run within the package you’re wanting to download, in order to get it
to work.</li>
<li>Then click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>

<h2>7. Introducing RMarkdown</h2>
<p><strong>RMarkdown files</strong> are a very versatile R file-type
that has a few advantages over more ‘traditional’ R scripts. In fact, I
like to think of them as a more sophisticated version of the Scripts
that we’ve already been worked with (see section <a
href="#creating-your-first-r-script">4.2. Creating your first R
Script</a>).</p>
<p>Like Scripts, RMarkdown files they typically contain sections of R
code, which are bookended by ‘comments’ around them that explain the
intended functionality of the code and characteristics of the data that
is being worked on.</p>
<p>However, <strong>a particular advantage RMarkdown files have over R
Scripts is that they can be used to output a number of documents
(e.g. HTML webpages, PDFs or Word files)</strong> that report the code
and its output, which can be read outside of R. Consequently, RMarkdown
files are what you’ll spend a lot of your time working with if you are
prepping code to share publicly. Equally, they’ll be what you spend a
lot of time looking at if you are viewing other people’s published
analyses or working through online tutorials to up-skill further in R.<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>We’re going to create our own RMarkdown file and use it to output an
MS Word document that is a summary of the content of the <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_R_script.R</em></span> we created
earlier. By going through the steps to do this, we will demonstrate some
of the additional key features that are available within RMarkdown.
These will help you format and produce more openly-accessible versions
of your code.</p>
<div id="creating-your-first-rmarkdown-file" class="section level3">
<h3>7.1. Creating your first RMarkdown file</h3>
<p>To create your first RMarkdown file:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the drop-down menu at the top of RStudio select <strong>File &gt;
New File &gt; R Markdown…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>new R Markdown</strong> window that opens give your

<div id="exploring-and-editing-the-rmarkdown-file"

<h3>7.2. Exploring and editing the RMarkdown file</h3>
<p>Your new RMarkdown file will now have appeared in the code editor. At
the top of it are the details you specified in setting it up (i.e. it’s
title, author etc…). Scrolling down you’ll see it already includes some
‘template’ text which gives instructions and suggestions on how to lay
out the file.</p>
<p>When you get familiar with using RMarkdown files you’ll probably just
delete these pointers and get on with drafting your own work. For now
though, they give you some good illustrations of the structure of a
markdown file. Over the final few sections of this workshop we’ll edit
these sections, to demonstrate some key points about how the RMarkdown
files work and are laid out. For now though, let’s have a look at
them.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> the numbering of these section in the image below
correspond to the numberin sub-sections that follow here.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/my_first_rmd.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div id="the-header" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.1. the Header</h4>
<p>This section will appear at the top of the Word document your
markdown will later output. It contains all the pertinent metadata
associated with your file (e.g. who wrote it, when it was created).
There’s nothing we need to change here so we’ll move on.</p>
</div>
<div id="chunks-of-r-code" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.2. Chunks of R code</h4>
<p>This is an example of a chunk of R code that will be embedded in the
document your Rmarkdown file outputs. <strong>Chunks of code are ‘marked
out’ by having a grey background in the markdown file</strong>. This
helps distinguish them from white sections of ‘plain text’ that appear
around them, which typically provides supporting commentary and
explanation for the code chunks.</p>
<p>Sections of code are bookended by three “backticks”
(i.e. <code>```</code> ) and on the first line of a code chunk there’s a
bracketed section that has to begin <code>{r</code> and ends with
another closing <code>}</code>. You can insert a name for this section
after the r in this bracket, which won’t appear in the outputted file.
In this example chunk its name is <code>setup</code>. After the name you
can insert a further argument (after a comma) that gives some
instructions as to how you want the code chunk to be handled in the
outputted file. I will call this the <strong>Header line</strong> for a
code chunk.</p>
<p>The <code>include=FALSE</code> argument used in the Header line tells
R not to include either the code or its output in the resulting
document.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Let’s make some changes to the Header
line so it reflects what we did in our first R script, back in section
[5.2.1. Command R to ‘do something’].</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the name of this chunk to: <code>Simple Sum</code></li>
<li>Change the argument for how you want it handled from
<code>include=FALSE</code> to <code>eval=TRUE</code>. This instruction
will mean that the code you put in this chunk will be displayed in the
outputted Word Document as well as its output.</li>
<li>Remove line 9<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and replace with the first two lines from
your <span style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_R_script.R</em></span> file
(i.e. the lines with the sum and the comment that follows it,
illustrated back in section <a href="#comment-on-your-commands">5.2.2.
Comment on your commands</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="plain-text-i.e.-not-r-code" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.3. Plain text (i.e. not ‘R code’)</h4>
<p>This section gives an example of some plain text that would appear in
the document your RMarkdown file outputs. At the moment this exemplar
text gives you a link to more details on RMarkdown files and some
instructions on what the ‘Knit’ button in the toolbar helps you do.
<em>Note:</em> We’ll get to knitting later, don’t worry about that for
now though!</p>
<p>This section (from lines 12 to 16) can be thought of as being
equivalent to the # marked ‘comments’ we made in our original R Script.
In other words, they are what we’ll use to provide context and
explanations in support of our chunks of R code.</p>
<p>Typically, in this ‘metadata’ we want to use formatting (as we would
in a text file) to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Structure what we want to say under headings and into
paragraphs.</li>
<li>Provide emphasis on certain points or words</li>
<li>Insert hyperlinks to other resources or references.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can set this all up here using a bit of simple formatting. Let’s
do this by overwriting the default text with the following:</p>
<div id="headings" class="section level5">
<h5>7.2.3.1. Headings</h5>
<p>Starting with <strong>Headings</strong>, in an RMarkdown file the #
symbol means something different from when it is used in an R Script. A
# in front of a line of plain text indicates it should be formatted as a
Heading. You can nest sub-headings within headings too, by double
(i.e. ## ) or triple (i.e. ###) hashing sub-headings and sub-sub
headings, respectively.</p>
<p>To try this out, replace the <span style="color: blue;">##R
Markdown</span> line (line 12) with the following text. This sets out a
structure for one main heading and two sub-headings beneath it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setting up my project

## Uploading my data

## Extra formatting tips</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="paragraphs" class="section level5">
<h5>7.2.3.2. Paragraphs</h5>
<p>Breaking up text within these new sections into
<strong>paragraphs</strong> is obviously important for structuring what
you want to say too. Under the first subheading write as following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setting up my project

## Uploading my data

This is how you upload a dataset. 

It is really easy!

## Extra formatting tips</code></pre>
<p>You need to <strong>put an <span style="color: red;">empty
line</span><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> between each paragraph and between the
last paragraph and the next heading</strong>. That space informs R that
these need formatted as separate paragraphs. If you don’t leave a line
between each paragraph in R the text will all run them together into one
big, messy, block. 😖</p>
</div>
<div id="emphasis" class="section level5">
<h5>7.2.3.3. Emphasis</h5>
<p><strong>Emphasis</strong> can also be placed on particular words and
phrases. One example of this would be to <strong>put certain words in
bold</strong>. To give the instruction to place certain words/phrases in
bold within an RMarkdown file you need to bookend them with a double
asterisk either side, as illustrated for the fourth line in the example
below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setting up my project

## Uploading my data

This is how you upload a dataset. 

**It is really easy!**

## Extra formatting tips</code></pre>

<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Lots of other types of formatting, besides simply adding Headings and
putting things in Bold, are available in RMarkdown but I’ll leave you to
discover further formatting tricks, should you wish to learn them, at
another time.</p>
<p>There’s a really good tutorial that goes into the further, formatting
related, things you can do in RMarkdown that has been written by Chester
Ismay, which can be founnd online here:</p>

<p>In it they explains how to italicise plain text, strikethrough
statements, add horizontal rules, insert quotations, equations,
bullet-points and numbered lists and more!</p>

</div>
<div id="inserting-links" class="section level5">
<h5>7.2.3.4. Inserting Links</h5>
<p>Lastly, we can <strong>insert links</strong> into our plain text.
This is handy when we want to provide external links to papers we’ve
referenced or want to direct people to open access webpages where our
publications or data are available. Hyperlinks can be created by putting
the word we want to work as the clickable link in square brackets
<code>[click here ]</code> and then putting the link within round
brackets directly after this <code>(to go here)</code>. Let’s do this
under the second subheading by entering:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Setting up my project

## Uploading my data

This is how you upload a dataset.

<div id="adding-and-removing-chunks-of-r-code" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.4. Adding and Removing chunks of R code</h4>
<p>This section of the Rmarkdown file gives an example chunk of R code,
which has been entitled <code>cars</code> in its Header line. You’ll
note that there’s not another argument after this chunk’s name in the
bracket (unlike in section 7.2.2)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>. This would result in the code you put in
this chunk being displayed in the outputted Word Document as well as its
output. In other words RMarkdown presumes that the default for any chunk
of R code is <code>eval = TRUE</code>.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>. <em>Note:</em> the
<code>eval =</code> argument’s function within a code chunk’s Header
line was already discussed in section <a href="#chunks-of-r-code">7.2.2.
Chunks of R code</a>.</p>
<p>In our Markdown file <strong>we don’t need this chunk of R code
though. So, simply highlight these three lines and press Delete
them</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Instead</strong>, let’s add a couple of chunks of R code
underneath the “Uploading my data” sub-heading, as illustrated
below:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/rmd_code_chunks.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br> You can just type these new lines out or:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Insert</strong> button in the toolbar for the
RMarkdown file (circled in <span style="color: red;">red</span>
above).</li>
<li>In the drop-down menu that appears <strong>select R</strong>, below
this option you’ll see there are further options to insert code chunks
from other programming languages too.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat this process to create two code chunks</strong>: one
that spans lines 18-20 and one that spans lines 22-24, as shown in the
figure above.</li>
<li>Into both chunks insert the line of R code that created the <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_dataset</em></span> object in your
project’s environment, from the <span
style="color: blue;">ExampleSDQ_data.csv</span> file earlier (see
section <a href="#the-environment-top-right-pane">5.3. The Environment
(top right pane)</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To finish up, let’s play around with how these two chunks will be
treated in the final output. Do this by updating the code in the Header
lines of the respective chunks as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>In the first chunk</strong>, update the <code>{r}</code>
bracket so it reads <code>{r show_dont_do, eval = FALSE}</code>. The
<code>eval = FALSE</code> argument here will mean that this chunk of R
code will be displayed but it won’t be run (AKA <em>evaluated</em>) in
the R console . This can be useful when you want to show a bit of code
in your final document but don’t actually want it to be run.
<em>Scenarios where this might be useful are if:</em>
<ul>
<li>In writing a document for teaching purposes, you want to demonstrate
a common coding error.</li>
<li>Sometimes there are multiple versions of your analysis code that you
want to present to aid a reader’s understanding (e.g. explaining earlier
iterations of a model you refined over several steps). However, whilst
you may want to show all this code, you might also only want to ‘run’
the code for the final model, so only its results appear in the final
document.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>In the second chunk</strong>, update the <code>{r}</code>
bracket so it reads <code>{r dont_show_but_do, include = FALSE}</code>.
The <code>include = FALSE</code> argument means the code will run
(i.e. the object <span
style="color: blue;"><em>my_first_dataset</em></span> will be created)
but neither this chunk or the output will appear in the document created
by this RMarkdown. <em>Scenarios where this might be useful are if:</em>
<ul>
<li>When you want some code to be run <em>in the background</em> to help
create the document, which the reader does not need to be aware of. For
example, importing a dataset into your environment from a local
directory on your computer that an external reader will have to obtain
by other means.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The different ways we’ve set up the Header lines in these two chunks
has illustrated nicely the flexibility we have to turn “on” and “off”
chunks of code, and even having them run in the background.</p>
<p>In terms of what we’re trying to do in these chunks though
(i.e. simply uploading our dataset into the environment), the use of two
chunks is overcomplicating things.</p>
<p>The most efficient choice here would be just one chunk, with
<code>eval=TRUE</code> probably being the most appropriate argument to
include in its Header line, to instruct R on how you want it
handled.</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="including-output-without-its-code" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.5. Including output without its code</h4>
<p>There’s one last option we can apply to handling chunks of R code
which we haven’t covered yet. This is shown in section 7.2.5. of the
template Rmarkdown file. In this section the code chunk creates a plot
and will include this plot in the document created <em>but without also
including a copy of the R code chunk that created it!</em> <br></p>
<p>It’s not unusual, when creating visualisations (e.g. graphs) in R, to
want the final document to simple show the graph itself but not the
‘underlying’ lines of code we used to create it. Often, these are
unnecessary clutter. To run an R code chunk and display its output but
hide the chunk itself we use the argument <code>echo = FALSE</code> in
the Header line for the chunk. That’s the case in this code chunk here,
circled in <span style="color: red;">red</span>.</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/plot_without_code.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br> <em>Note:</em> In the above code we’ve also amended the code
chunk in the template so that it presents data from the SDQ dataset we
imported earlier.</p>
<p>There are two arguments that need inputs in the <em>plot()</em>
function here, separated by a comma <code>,</code>. These indicate the
data you want placed on the X and Y axis of this plot. - The
<strong>first argument</strong>
(<code>my_first_dataset$Age_Years</code>) tells R the variable you want
presented on the <strong>x-axis of this plot</strong>. This variables
name includes the name of the variable <code>Age_Years</code>
<em>and</em> a prefix that tells R which dataframe
(<code>my_first_dataset</code>) it can be found in, with these two bits
of information linked by a <code>$</code> sign.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> - The <strong>second
argument</strong> (<code>my_first_dataset$TDS</code>) tells R the
variable you want presented on the <strong>y-axis</strong> of this plot.
<em>Note:</em> TDS stands for “Total Difficulties Score” and is a
continuous score (out of 20) calculated from response to a
questionnaire.</p>
<div class="boxout">
<div class="center">
<p><strong>Extra tips/pointers:</strong></p>
</div>
<p><code>plot()</code> is actually a pretty basic graphing function. It
has allowed us to illustrate a point here but one of R’s advantages is
the really flexible visualisation packages you can use within it. One,
called <code>ggplot2</code> is extremely popular and is part of the
<code>tidyverse</code> family of packages we mentioned (see section <a
href="#installing-new-packages">6.3.1. Installing new Packages</a>).
There’s a really good online tutorial on how to get started with
<code>ggplot2</code> that I’ll point out to you at the end of this
workshop, if you’re interested in learning more about it.</p>

<div id="in-lining-r-code-in-the-plain-text" class="section level4">
<h4>7.2.6. In-lining R code in the plain text</h4>
<p>The last section of the RMarkdown template file (7.2.6) gives an
illustration of how you can ‘in-line’ R code into the plain text
sections of your documents. This can be handy when you want to
quote/refer to parts of your code in the surrounding comments. You’ll
have seen me do it several times already in this material!</p>
<p>Using RMarkdown you can quote code in your writing (in the
font/format it displays in RStudio) by putting it in back-quotes
<code></code>code here<code></code>.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. In the template example, back-quotes
have been use to pick out <code>echo = FALSE</code> as a bit of R code
appearing within the plain text of your Markdown file. To practice doing
this yourself, edit this section so it reads:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/example_of_inlining.png" /></p>

<p><br> In this section the inline function is used in an explanation of
R’s <code>help()</code> function. Then, in the second paragraph, you’ve
also shown how you can use inlined code to run certain calculations in
the plain text. That’s not apparent here but it will be when we “knit”
this into our final output document, which is what we’ll do next!😁</p>

<h3>7.3. Knitting the RMarkdown file into an HTML or Word doc</h3>
<p>In RMarkdown the creation of a document from the markdown file
(e.g. as a .html, .docx or .pdf file) is referred to as ‘knitting’ it
together.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. My advice would be to first create your
document as a .html file (i.e. webpage) because this will automatically
create a preview of it in the viewer panel in the bottom right hand pane
of RStudio, if you follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First, <strong>click on the Cog symbol</strong> in the toolbar of
your RMarkdown file and <strong>in the drop down menu ensure the Preview
in Viewer Pane option is selected</strong>. See illustration below:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/knit_to_html1.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p></li>
<li><p>Next, <strong>click on the downward pointing triangle next to the
word Knit</strong> in the toolbar, and in this drop-down menu
<strong>select Knit to HTML</strong>. See illustration below:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/knit_to_html2.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p></li>
<li><p>The console should whirr away for a moment, knitting together
your html file from the instructions in your RMarkdown file and when it
finishes you will <strong>see a preview of this .HTML version of the
final document in the Viewer tab in the bottom right hand pane</strong>,
which you can scroll down through. See illustration below:</p>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/knit_to_html3.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down through it and see if everything is formatted as you
would expect it to. If you switch to the Files tab (circled in <span
style="color: red;">red</span> in the previous image) you will also see
that several new files have been added to your R Project’s folder, most
importantly, you’ll see an icon for the <span
style="color: blue;">my_first_RMarkdown.html</span> file that you were
just previewing in the viewer. This is circled in <span
style="color: red;">red</span> in the image below.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="bordered">
<p><img src="images/knit_to_html4.png" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you’d like to see how it would display in a web browser you, just
click on this file and <strong>select the View in Browser
option</strong> and it’ll open up in your web browser.</li>
<li><strong>If you spot any errors</strong> or just want to play around
with the formatting or layout some more, simply <strong>make the changes
necessary to the RMarkdown file</strong> in the code editor and
<strong>then repeat your ‘knitting’ the document</strong>. This will
update the html file, applying any further edits you’ve made to it.</li>
<li>Lastly, <strong>to output an RMarkdown file as a Word document
instead</strong>, repeat steps 1 and 2 but when you get to the drop-down
menu in the second step select <strong>Knit to Word</strong> instead.
<strong>This will create a <span

directory</strong>, which should auto-open on your desktop. See
illustration of this new file, highlighted in <span
style="color: red;">red</span>, in the image below. If it doesn’t
auto-open then you can click on it in your Project directory and it
should open in Word, allowing you to go in and inspect how it’s been
laid out.</li>

<p>This brings us to the end of our beginners tour through the R
environment and its workflow.</p>
<p>At this point, take a moment to reflect on all that you’ve learned.
I’m hopeful that you’ll feel you now have a clearer understanding of the
mechanics of how R works. Not a perfect understanding yet but you’re
definitely on your way! 😁</p>
<p><strong>For example, after only a few hours you now know how
to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Set up your own projects in R.</strong> <strong>2. Carry
out some activities within these project using R (e.g. importing data,
plotting it).</strong> <strong>3. Publish the results of these
activities in a format you could then share with others!</strong></p>

uses. For example, I used it to create this webpage! Data handling and
analysis are two areas in which it really excels though.<a

<li id="fn4"><p>Open Analysis is one of several core tenets within Open
Science<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>For example, back in the early 2000’s I learned SPSS as
an undergraduate but then found I had to learn an entirely different
stats package (STATA) to work effectively with colleagues in a local
health service. STATA was the only stats package the health service were
willing to pay the license fee for, so I had to fall in line. Nowadays,
my colleagues and I all simply use R to work together, or another open
source equivalent!<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Just “F!!king Around and Finding Out!”<a href="#fnref6"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I wrote these instructions whilst downloading R and
RStudio onto my personal laptop (a Macbook) as I don’t have admin rights
to download onto my work laptop, which already has R and RStudio
installed on it.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>For ease of access I also drag-and-dropped this icon
onto the toolbar at the bottom of my desktop so I can access RStudio
quickly in the future (i.e. without going back into applications and
scrolling down to find it)<a href="#fnref8"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>It would be fairly straightforward to then upload this
Project to online open-access platforms (e.g. like the <a
href="https://osf.io/">OSF</a>) where you may already have
pre-registered these studies’ hypotheses. When you then get to the stage
your work’s been accepted for publication it’s then very easy to make
your data and analysis files publicly available via such platforms - and
you can pat yourself on the back for doing great Open Research 🥳<a
href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Yes, let’s anthropomorphise R and think of them as a
person, a somewhat complicated person who is (at times) difficult to
speak with but someone who, deep down, is very interested in helping
you! <a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>If we’re anthropomorphising Rstudio too, you can think
of them as a friend to both you and R, who speaks both your languages,
to a reasonable degree, and that has sat you and R down around the same
table and is trying to help you communicate in a productive manner with
each other.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>e.g. the <code>brms</code> package for doing Bayesian
modelling, the <code>lme4</code> package for doing multi-level
modelling, the <code>lavaan</code> package for doing structural equation
modelling, the <code>wrs2</code> packed for robust methods (i.e. a lot
of functionality that you can’t get to the same degree in SPSS)! 🤩<a
href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>A lot of online tutorials are created published using
RMarkdown. Like this one! 😁<a href="#fnref13"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>R will run the code but its output will be ‘hidden’,
not appearing, in the final outputted document.<a href="#fnref14"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>the one that reads
<code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)</code><a href="#fnref15"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>This is sometimes referred to as a ’line break’<a
href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>e.g. where there was a further argument of
<code>include = FALSE</code> or <code>eval = TRUE</code><a
href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>So did we need to specify <code>eval = TRUE</code> for
the previous chunk in section <a href="#chunks-of-r-code">7.2.2. Chunks
of R code</a>? 🤔 No, R would have defaulted to doing this anyway. It
did gave us an opportunity to discuss what this argument does though,
and an opportunity to show you how to edit it<a href="#fnref18"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>For example, they may need to instead download your
data from an online open access repository<a href="#fnref19"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>It might seem obvious right now that this variables is
within this dataframe because that is the only dataset we have uploaded
to the R environment. However, when you got further on in your work in R
it is very possible you will have multiple dataframes in use
simultaneously. Thus R requires us, from the outset, to prefix each
variable’s name with the name of the dataframe if comes from, so what
we’re asking for is always clear. <a href="#fnref20"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>What’s a back-quote look like? It’s like a ‘small
apostrophe’. On a regular QWERTY keyboard you’ll usually find it just
above the shift key and to the left of the 1.<a href="#fnref21"
class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>A charmingly eccentric term, if you ask me! 🧶<a
