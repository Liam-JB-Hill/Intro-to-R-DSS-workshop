# Intro to R DSS workshop

This is a website I, [Liam Hill](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/liam-hill), built to host materials for a workshop I developed that 
introduces taught postgraduate students at the University of Edinburgh's School
of Education and Sports (Moray House) to R and RMarkdown.

***Acknowledgement:*** I used the Crump Lab's R Markdown website template for lab journals for the initial
build of this website. Forking form this Github repo: (https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite), and following the instructions in this youtube tutorial by Dr Matthew Crump: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc7XhQrasCM).
